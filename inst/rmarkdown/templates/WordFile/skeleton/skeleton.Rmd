```{r document, child = 'Introduction.rmd'}
```


```{r document, child = 'article_document.rmd'}
```

<!-- 

Write in article_document.rmd

The reference files, the csl, and the bib files are located to folders in the directory of the document. Same for the yaml of crossref.

Would be nice to figure out a way to link the pandoc arguments more automatically.
Now the path depends on the local OS and version.
