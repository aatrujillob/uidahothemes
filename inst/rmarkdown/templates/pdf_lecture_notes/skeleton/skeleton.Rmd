# Introduction

This handout will guide us through the topic of time value of money. 
The concepts of time value of money are the core of financial 
management. It is important to master them, that is why we will spend extra time going 
over many examples and explaining how to calculate them in Excel. 

Note: You will find all the examples in this handout done in Excel in the file
Weekxx_TVM.xlxs in bblearn.

# Learning objectives

- Understand the time value of money, including the role of compound interest.

- Determine the present values of (1) a future payment, (2) a nonuniform series 
of payments, (3) a uniform series of payments, and (4) a series of payments 
growing at a constant rate.

- Determine the future values of (1) a present sum, (2) a nonuniform series of 
payments, and (3) a uniform series of payments and (4) a series of payments 
growing at a constant rate.

- Understand annual interest and compounding

- Implement the formulas and calculations in Excel.

# The time value of money

Which payment do you prefer? \$1 dollar today, or \$1 dollar a year from now?
Why? and if you currently would live in Venezuela or Zimbabwe? What will make
both payments indifferent/equal?  

\newpage
## Concepts of time value of money

### Interest rate

An interest rate serves as the pricing mechanism for the time value of money. 
It reflects the collective effects of all investors' time preferences for money and the
productive uses of such money. The rate per period is considered an exchange price between
present and future dollars.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

\draw[|-|](0,0)--(5,0);
 
%\draw (5,-.2)--(5,.2);
\node[align=left,below] at (-1.5, -0.2) {Cash flow};
\node[align=left,above] at (-1.5,0.2) {Time period};

\node[align=left,above] at (0,0.2) {0};
\node[align=left,above] at (5,0.2) {1};
 
\node[align=left,below] at (0,-0.2) {\$100};
\node[align=left,below] at (5,-0.2) {\$110};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Here, we would be indifferent between \$100 today and \$110 in the next period 
if the interest rate is 10\%.

### Compound interest

Compound interest is the basis of the concept of time value of money. 
The time value concept uses compound interest to determine present and
future values. Compound interest means that each time interest is paid, 
it is added to, or compounded into the principal, and thereafter also earns 
interest. The other case, when interest is not compound is called simple 
interest, interest is still paid each period, but is not added to the principal. 

Let's check the following example in table \ref{tab:1} (See also the Excel file
Week03_TVM.xlxs) to make it clear. Let's assume we invest \$1000 dollars, for 3
years, at an interest rate per period (i) of 5\%. Then, we would have:

- After 1 year: $1000 \times (1+0.05) = 1050$
- After 2 year: $1000 \times (1+0.05) \times (1+0.05) = 1102.50$
- After 3 year: $1000 \times (1+0.05)^3 = 1157.63$

\begin{table}[htbp]
 \caption{Compound vs Simple}
  \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|rrr|rrr|}
          & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Compound Interest} &  \multicolumn{3}{c}{Simple Interest}   \\
    Period & Capital & Interest & Total & Capital & Interest & Total \\
    \midrule
    \multicolumn{1}{r|}{0} &       &       & 1000.00 &       &       & 1000.00 \\
    \multicolumn{1}{r|}{1} & 1000.00 & 50.00 & 1050.00 & 1000.00 & 50.00 & 1000.00 \\
    \multicolumn{1}{r|}{2} & 1050.00 & 52.50 & 1102.50 & 1000.00 & 50.00 & 1000.00 \\
    \multicolumn{1}{r|}{3} & 1102.50 & 55.13 & 1157.63 & 1000.00 & 50.00 & 1000.00 \\
    Total Interest &       & 157.63 &       &       & 150.00 &  \\
    \end{tabular}%

  \label{tab:1}%
\end{table}

Here, we can see that the compound interest yields an excess over the simple 
interest of \$7.63. This difference will grow exponentially through time, thus 
the strenght of interest compounding for finance decisions.

## Overview of calculation rules

Now we will go over the basic scenarios of time value of money and how to 
calculate them. Those scenarios are;

\begin{enumerate}
\item Single payment, future value of present payment 
\item Single payment, present value of future payment
\item Series of payments, present value
\item Uniform series of payments, present value
\item Infinite uniform series of payments, present value 
\item Series of payments, future value
\item Uniform series of payments, future value
\item Constant growth series of payments, present value 
\end{enumerate}

### Single payment, future value of present payment 

The future value of a present payment is the same case as the
example on table \ref{tab:1}, and can be summarized with the following equation:

\begin{equation}
 V_n = V_0 (1+i)^N
\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}

where $V_n$ is the value at time n, $i$ is the interest rate per conversion 
period, and $N$ is the number of conversion periods. 

#### Example 1

Example from the book. What is the future value of \$ 1000 compounded at 5\% for
10 years?

\begin{tikzpicture}[
pile/.style={thick, ->, >=stealth'}]

\draw [|-|](0,0)--(10,0);
\draw (0,-.1)--(0,.1);
\draw (1,-.2)--(1,.2);
\draw (2,-.2)--(2,.2);
\draw(3,-.2)--(3,.2);
\draw (4,-.2)--(4,.2);
\draw (5,-.2)--(5,.2);
\draw (6,-.2)--(6,.2);
\draw (7,-.2)--(7,.2);
\draw (8,-.2)--(8,.2);
\draw (9,-.2)--(9,.2);
\draw (10,-.2)--(10,.2);
\node[align=left,below] at (-1.5, -0.2) {Cash flow};
\node[align=left,above] at (-2.0,0.2) {Time period (year)};

\node[align=left,above] at (0,0.2) {0};
\node[align=left,above] at (1,0.2) {1};
\node[align=left,above] at (2,0.2) {2};
\node[align=left,above] at (3,0.2) {3};
\node[align=left,above] at (4,0.2) {4};
\node[align=left,above] at (5,0.2) {5};
\node[align=left,above] at (6,0.2) {6};
\node[align=left,above] at (7,0.2) {7};
\node[align=left,above] at (8,0.2) {8};
\node[align=left,above] at (9,0.2) {9};
\node[align=left,above] at (10,0.2) {10};

\node[align=left,below] at (0,-1.4) {\$1000};
\node[align=left,below] at (10,2) {\$1629};


\draw[pile](0,0)--(0,-1.2);
\draw[pile](10,0)--(10,1.4);

\end{tikzpicture}

where: $V_0 = 1000$, $i = 5\%$ and $N=10$, then:
$V_{10} = 1000 \times (1+0.05)^{10} = 1629$


### Single payment, present value of future payment

The present value of a future payment, is just about flipping the
direction of what we just saw in the case of a future value of a present 
payment. So we just need to look at equation \ref{eq:1} and solve for $V_0$, that yields:

\begin{equation}
V_0 = \frac{V_N}{(1+i)^N}
\label{eq:2}
\end{equation}

#### Example 2

What is the present value of a \$2191.12 payment available in 20 years from now
if the interest rate is 4\%?  

So we want to find the value of $V_0$ when $V_N = \$2191.12$, $i=4\%$, and $N=20$,
so:

$\displaystyle V_0 = \frac{2191.12}{(1+0.04)^{20}} = 1000$


### Series of payments, present value

Finding the present value of a series of payments is one of the most common
problems in financial management. The procedure to determine it is just an
extension of the procedure to find the present value of a single future payment.
Take for instance, what is the present value of the following series, discounted
at 8\% per year.
 
#### Example 3

\begin{tikzpicture}

\draw [|->](0,0)--(6,0);
\draw (0,-.1)--(0,.1);
\draw (1,-.2)--(1,.2);
\draw (2,-.2)--(2,.2);
\draw(3,-.2)--(3,.2);
\draw (4,-.2)--(4,.2);
\draw (5,-.2)--(5,.2);
\node[align=left,below] at (-1.5, -0.2) {Cash flow};
\node[align=left,above] at (-2.0,0.2) {Time period (year)};

\node[align=left,above] at (0,0.2) {0};

\node[align=left,above] at (2,0.2) {2};

\node[align=left,below] at (4,-0.2) {\$6000};
\node[align=left,below] at (5,-0.2) {\$7000};


\node[align=left,above] at (-1.5,-1.5) {$\frac{\$3000}{(1.08)^1}$ = 2777.8};
\node[align=left,above] at (-1.5,-2.3) {$\frac{\$4000}{(1.08)^2}$ = 3429.4};
\node[align=left,above] at (-1.5,-3.1) {$\frac{\$5000}{(1.08)^3}$ = 3969.2};
\node[align=left,above] at (-1.5,-3.9) {$\frac{\$6000}{(1.08)^4}$ = 4410.2};
\node[align=left,above] at (-1.5,-4.7) {$\frac{\$7000}{(1.08)^5}$ = 4764.1};
\node[align=left,above] at (-2.2,-5.3) {Present Value = 19350.6};
\node[align=left,above] at (3.2,-5.3) {Discount Rate= 8\% annual};


\draw (1,-.8)--(1,-1.0);
\draw [<-](0,-1.0)--(1,-1.0);

\draw (2,-.8)--(2,-1.8);
\draw [<-](0,-1.8)--(2,-1.8);

\draw (3,-.8)--(3,-2.6);
\draw [<-](0,-2.6)--(3,-2.6);

\draw (4,-.8)--(4,-3.4);
\draw [<-](0,-3.4)--(4,-3.4);

\draw (5,-.8)--(5,-4.2);
\draw [<-](0,-4.2)--(5,-4.2);

\end{tikzpicture}

This can be expressed more generally as:

$$ V_0 = \displaystyle \frac{P_1}{(1+i)} + \frac{P_2}{(1+i)^2} + \dots + \frac{P_N}{(1+i)^N} $$
or 
\begin{equation}
V_0 = \sum_{n=0}^N \frac{P_n}{(1+i)^n}
\label{eq:3}
\end{equation}

where  

$V_0 =$  the present value of the payment series  
$P_n =$  the payment for each conversion period (n)  
$i =$ the interest rate  
$\sum =$ the summation from N=0 to N   

### Uniform series of payments, present value

The present value of a uniform series of payments is just a special case of the 
previous case. If we call the uniform series of payments $A$ (for annuity), then we 
can express it as:

$$ V_0 = \sum_{n=0}^N \frac{A}{(1+i)^n} $$
or  

\begin{equation} 
V_0 = \displaystyle \frac{A}{(1+i)} + \frac{A}{(1+i)^2} + \dots + \frac{A}{(1+i)^N} 
\label{eq:4}
\end{equation}

With some algebra tricks we can make a "short" equation out of this:
Let's multiply equation \ref{eq:4} by $(1+i)$ that yields:

\begin{equation}
V_0(1+i) = \displaystyle A + \frac{A}{(1+i)} + \frac{A}{(1+i)^2} + \dots + \frac{A}{(1+i)^N-1} 
\label{eq:5}
\end{equation}

if we subtract \ref{eq:4} from \ref{eq:5} that gives:

$$ V_0(1+i) - V_0 = A -  \frac{A}{(1+i)^N}$$

reorganizing and solving for $V_0$ yields:

\begin{equation}
V_0 = A \Big[ \frac{1-(1+i)^{-N}}{i}  \Big]
\label{eq:6}
\end{equation}

#### Example 4

As an example, let's suppose that oil-royalty payments are expected to pay \$5000 
at the end of each of the next 5 years. The interest rate is 8\%. What is the present
value?

$$V_0 = 5000 \Big[ \frac{1-(1+0.08)^{-5}}{i}  \Big] = 19963.55$$

#### Example 5 

What would happen if the payment is not at the end of each period but at the
beginning of the periodinstead? like paying for a membership? That would slightly
change things.

In the first scenario payments look like the following:

\begin{tikzpicture}

\draw [|-](0,0)--(5,0);
\draw (0,-.1)--(0,.1);
\draw (1,-.2)--(1,.2);
\draw (2,-.2)--(2,.2);
\draw(3,-.2)--(3,.2);
\draw (4,-.2)--(4,.2);
\draw (5,-.2)--(5,.2);
\node[align=left,below] at (-1.5, -0.2) {Cash flow};
\node[align=left,above] at (-2.0,0.2) {Time period (year)};

\node[align=left,above] at (0,0.2) {0};
\node[align=left,above] at (1,0.2) {1};
\node[align=left,above] at (2,0.2) {2};
\node[align=left,above] at (3,0.2) {3};
\node[align=left,above] at (4,0.2) {4};
\node[align=left,above] at (5,0.2) {5};
\node[align=left,below] at (1,-0.2) {\$5000};
\node[align=left,below] at (2,-0.2) {\$5000};
\node[align=left,below] at (3,-0.2) {\$5000};
\node[align=left,below] at (4,-0.2) {\$5000};
\node[align=left,below] at (5,-0.2) {\$5000};
\node[align=left,above] at (-2.2,-1.3) {Present Value = 19963};
\node[align=left,above] at (3.2,-1.3) {Discount Rate= 8\% annual};

\end{tikzpicture}

but if payments occur at the beginning of the period then the payments would
look like:

\begin{tikzpicture}

\draw [|-](0,0)--(5,0);
\draw (0,-.1)--(0,.1);
\draw (1,-.2)--(1,.2);
\draw (2,-.2)--(2,.2);
\draw(3,-.2)--(3,.2);
\draw (4,-.2)--(4,.2);
\draw (5,-.2)--(5,.2);
\node[align=left,below] at (-1.5, -0.2) {Cash flow};
\node[align=left,above] at (-2.0,0.2) {Time period (year)};

\node[align=left,above] at (0,0.2) {0};
\node[align=left,above] at (1,0.2) {1};
\node[align=left,above] at (2,0.2) {2};
\node[align=left,above] at (3,0.2) {3};
\node[align=left,above] at (4,0.2) {4};
\node[align=left,above] at (5,0.2) {5};
\node[align=left,below] at (0,-0.2) {\$5000};
\node[align=left,below] at (1,-0.2) {\$5000};
\node[align=left,below] at (2,-0.2) {\$5000};
\node[align=left,below] at (3,-0.2) {\$5000};
\node[align=left,below] at (4,-0.2) {\$5000};
\node[align=left,above] at (-2.2,-1.3) {Present Value = 21,560.63};
\node[align=left,above] at (3.2,-1.3) {Discount Rate= 8\% annual};

\end{tikzpicture}

To calculate the present value of this special case, we can start with equation
\ref{eq:6}, add $A$ to it, and subtract $A/(1+i)^N$. After rearraging we would 
have:

\begin{equation}
V_0 = {A}{(1+ i)} \Big[ \frac{1 - (1+i)^{-N}}{i} \Big]
\label{eq:7}
\end{equation}


### Infinite uniform series of payments, present value 

What happens to the present value of a series of uniform payments when these payment
are infinite?
Notice that the formula for the present value of a series of payments (equation
\ref{eq:6}) can be rewritten as:

$$V_0 = \frac{A}{i} - \frac{A}{i(1+i)^N} $$

since payments are infinite then $\displaystyle \lim_{N\to\infty} V_0 = \frac{A}{i}$
since the second element will tend to zero as N grows.  Thus:


\begin{equation}
V_0 = \frac{A}{i}
\label{eq:8}
\end{equation}

#### Example 6

You have a piece of land that would give an infinite number of annual payments of
\$1000, you expect the interest rate to remain at 5\%. For how much could you sell
this piece of land today?

$\displaystyle V_0 = \frac{1000}{0.05} = 20000$

### Series of payments, future value

The future value of a series of payments is calculated by adding up the future value
of each payment. The following picture shows the cash flows:


\begin{tikzpicture}[
pile/.style={thick, ->, >=stealth'}]

\draw [|-|](0,0)--(7,0);
\draw (0,-.1)--(0,.1);
\draw (1,-.2)--(1,.2);
\draw (2,-.2)--(2,.2);
\draw(3,-.2)--(3,.2);
\draw (4,-.2)--(4,.2);
\draw (5,-.2)--(5,.2);
\draw (6,-.2)--(6,.2);
\draw (7,-.2)--(7,0.25);
\node[align=left,below] at (-1.5, -0.2) {Cash flow};
\node[align=left,above] at (-2.0,0.2) {Time period (year)};

\node[align=left,above] at (0,0.2) {0};
\node[align=left,above] at (1,0.2) {1};
\node[align=left,above] at (2,0.2) {2};
\node[align=left,above] at (3,0.2) {3};
\node[align=left,above] at (4,0.2) {\dots};
\node[align=left,above] at (5,0.2) {N-2};
\node[align=left,above] at (6,0.2) {N-1};
\node[align=left,above] at (7,0.2) {N};


\node[align=left,below] at (1,-1.4) {$P_1$};
\node[align=left,below] at (2,-1.4) {$P_2$};
\node[align=left,below] at (3,-1.4) {$P_3$};
\node[align=left,below] at (5,-1.4) {$P_{N-2}$};
\node[align=left,below] at (6,-1.4) {$P_{N-1}$};
\node[align=left,below] at (7,-1.4) {$P_{N}$};

\node[align=left,below] at (7,3) {$V_N$};


\draw[pile](1,0)--(1,-1.2);
\draw[pile](2,0)--(2,-1.2);
\draw[pile](3,0)--(3,-1.2);
\draw[pile](5,0)--(5,-1.2);
\draw[pile](6,0)--(6,-1.2);
\draw[pile](7,0)--(7,-1.2);
\draw[pile](7,0.5)--(7,2.4);

\end{tikzpicture}

This can be translated into the following equations:


$$ V_n = P_1(1+i)^{N-1} + P_2(1+i)^{N-2} + \dots + P_{N-1}(1+i) + P_N $$
or more generally

\begin{equation}
\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^N P_n(1+i)^{N-n}
\label{eq:9}
\end{equation}

#### Example 7

What is the future value of 5 payments end of the year: \$3,000, \$4,000, \$5,000,
\$6,000 and \$7,000; i = 8\%
$V_5 = 3,000*(1.08)^4 +...+7,000*(1.08)^0 =  28,432$


### Uniform series of payments, future value

Again, the procedure for finding the future value of a series of payments is
simplified when all payments are equal. Following the same procedure as the one shown
for the present value of an uniform series of payments, we can express

$$ V_n = A(1+i)^{N-1} + A(1+i)^{N-2} + \dots + A(1+i) + A $$
as

\begin{equation}
V_N = {A} \Big[ \frac{(1+i)^{-N}-1}{i} \Big]
\label{eq:10}
\end{equation}


### Example 8

What is the future value of a 5-year uniform series of \$5000 with an annual rate of
8\%?  

See Excel file.


### Constant growth series of payments, present value 

So far we have seen payment series that were uniform over time. Now let's
suppose that the payments experience a constant rate of growth (g). That's equivalent
to:

$V_0 = \displaystyle \frac{P_0(1+g)}{(1+i)} + \frac{P_0 (1+g)^2}{(1+i)^2} + \dots + \frac{P_0(1+g)^n}{(1+i)^n}$

with some algebra similar to the one shown to derive the present value of 
uniform series, the present value of a constant growth series of payments can be
expressed as:

\begin{equation}
V_0 = \frac{ {P_0}{(1+g)} \Big[ 1-  \Big( \frac{1+g}{1+i}  \Big)^N \Big]} {i-g}
\label{eq:11}
\end{equation}

In practice, we can still find the present value with equation \ref{eq:6} by
adjusting with a new discount rate (r), such that

$$1+r = \frac{1+i}{1+g}$$
Notice that this makes the series of $V_0$ above into

$$V_0 = \displaystyle \frac{P_0}{(1+r)} + \frac{P_0 }{(1+r)^2} + \dots + \frac{P_0}{(1+r)^n}$$

thus we can use the adjusted rate

$$r = \frac{1+i}{1+g} - 1$$
in the "old fashioned" present value of a uniform series.

#### Examples 9 and 10  

In Excel file.

## Annual interest rate and compounding

In finance, interest rates are expressed (almost always) as annual rates.
However, interest rates often have compounding periods shorter that a year. That
creates a bit of a complication since the rate will be expressed nominally as
annual but compounded over months, quarters, semesters, or any other period
within the year.

Suppose you take out a loan that requires monthly payments (example
from:https://www.online-tech-tips.com). Thus, interest is calculated monthly as
well. The nominal interest rate (annual percentage rate (APR)), is the monthly
interest rate (1\% per month) multiplied by twelve (the number of periods in a
year). This is 12\% interest rate with monthly compounding 

Since interest is compounded monthly, the actual or effective interest rate is
higher because interest in the current month compounds against interest in the
previous month. As it turns out, a 12\% APR (nominal) interest loan has an
effective (APY) interest rate of about 12.68\%. This can be calculated as:


\begin{equation}
\textnormal{Eff}\% = (1+\frac{\textnormal{Nom} \%}{m})^m - 1
\label{eq:effnominal}
\end{equation}

where *Eff* is the effective rate, *Nom* is the nominal rate, and $m$ is the number
of compounding periods per year.
