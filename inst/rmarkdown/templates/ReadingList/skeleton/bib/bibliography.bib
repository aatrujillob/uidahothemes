abstract = {The contract price on a forward contract stays fixed for the life of the contract, while a futures contract is rewritten every day. The value of a futures contract is zero at the start of each day. The expected change in the futures price satisfies a formula like the capital asset pricing model. If changes in the futures price are independent of the return on the market, the futures price is the expected spot price. The futures market is not unique in its ability to shift risk, since corporations can do that too. The futures market is unique in the guidance it provides for producers, distributors, and users of commodities. Using assumptions like those used in deriving the original option formula, we find formulas for the values of forward contracts and commodity options in terms of the futures price and other variables.},

We show that simultaneously buying contracts with high past performance, high roll-yields and low idiosyncratic volatility, and shorting contracts with poor past performance, low roll-yields and high idiosyncratic volatility yields a Sharpe ratio over the 1985 to 2011 period which is five times that of the S{\&}P-GSCI. The triple-screen strategy dominates the double-screen and individual strategies and this outcome cannot be attributed to overreaction, liquidity risk, transaction costs or the financialization of commodity futures markets.},

abstract = {The study of cointegration in large systems requires a reduction of their dimensionality. To achieve this, we propose to obtain the I(1) common factors in every subsystem and then analyze cointegration among them. In this article, a new way of estimating common long-memory components of a cointegrated system is proposed. The identification of these I(1) common factors is achieved by imposing that they be linear combinations of the original variables X(t), and that the error-correction terms do not cause the common factors at low frequencies. Estimation is done from a fully specified error-correction model, which makes it possible to test hypotheses on the common factors using standard chi-squared tests. Several empirical examples illustrate the procedure.},

abstract = {This article reviews recent econometric developments in the literature on price discovery and predictability. For both areas, we discuss traditional approaches to econometric modeling, limitations to these approaches, and recent developments designed to overcome them. We also discuss the state of the art and suggest future research. Three main conclusions are drawn. First, while many recent empirical applications in price discovery and price predictability are on the frontier of econometric methods, further developments are needed to increase relaxation of relevant assumptions and push the boundaries of applications. Second, future research in econometric modeling needs to combine/synthesize recent developments across multiple econometric issues, rather than proceeding in a piecemeal manner, for instance, by integrating developments in the time series literature into panel-based frameworks. Third, recent econometric literature is generating findings that challenge long-held beliefs about apparent empirical regularities in price discovery and price predictability, thus presenting opportunities to develop relevant theory.},

We show that a single factor, the high-minus-low portfolio from basis sorts, explains the cross-section of spot premia. Two additional basis factors are needed to explain the term premia.},

@article{Working1948,
abstract = {I N THE technical language of American futures markets, carrying charge refers to a difference at a given time between prices of a commodity for two different dates of delivery.! If prices of Chicago wheat futures, for example, were quoted as, September, {\$}1.30, December, {\$}1.38, and May, {\$}1.48, it would be said that the market showed a carrying charge of eight cents from September to December, of ten cents from December to May, and of eighteen cents from September to May. Carrying charges in the futures market sometimes approximate, or even exceed, the cost of holding the wheat in public storage at the regular rates (storage charges) fixed by the grain exchanges for such service, but more often they are less. Not infrequently prices of the deferred futures are below that of the near future; the market is then said to show an inverse carrying charge, or sometimes an "inverted," or a "reversed" carrying charge. In British usage, "contango" and "backwardation" refer to positive and inverse carrying charges respectively. There seems to be substantial agreement among writers on futures markets that positive carrying charges tend to reflect marginal net costs of storage, and that when carrying charges are positive, prices of near and distant futures must respond about equally to any causes of price change. With regard to inverse carrying charges there is more difference of opinion and much reason for the student of futures markets to be dissatisfied with the present state of theory. How shall one explain a large inverse carrying charge between December and May in a Uni{\~{}}ed States wheat market? Do inverse carrying charges reliably forecast price declines? When prices of deferred futures fall below the spot price, does the futures market tend to lose effective connection with the cash2 market? These are some specific questions that call for answer and to which no satisfactory reply seems to be offered by prevailing theory.},
